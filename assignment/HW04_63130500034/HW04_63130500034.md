Choose Dataset:
1. Top 270 Computer Science / Programing Books (Data from Thomas Konstantin, [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/thomaskonstantin/top-270-rated-computer-science-programing-books)) >> [Using CSV](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/safesit23/INT214-Statistics/main/datasets/prog_book.csv)



### Outlines
1. Explore the dataset
2. Learning function from Tidyverse
3. Transform data with dplyr and finding insight the data
4. Visualization with GGplot2

## Part 1: Explore the dataset

```
# Library
library(dplyr)
library(readr)      
library(ggplot2)

# Dataset
Books <- read_csv("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/safesit23/INT214-Statistics/main/datasets/prog_book.csv")
```

In this dataset has observation : 271 , variable : 7



## Part 2: Learning function from Tidyverse

- Function `str_trunc(string, width, side = c("right", "left", "center"), ellipsis = "...")` 
from package [dplyr](https://dplyr.tidyverse.org/articles/dplyr.html#select-columns-with-select) , [strc_trunc](https://stringr.tidyverse.org/reference/str_trunc.html). 

Funtion ตัวนี้จะทำการตัด string ที่เกิน width ที่กำหนดไว้ ในฝั่ง side ที่เรากำหนด ให้เป็นตัว ellipsis

```
str_trunc(string, width, side = c("right", "left", "center"), ellipsis = "...")
```


## Part 3: Transform data with dplyr and finding insight the data

1. Find the highest-rated books of ebook and paperback type.

```
BookPaperback <- Books %>% filter(Type == "Paperback")

BookPaperback %>%filter(Price == max(BookPaperback$Price) ) %>% select(Book_title) 
BookEbook %>%filter(Price == max(BookEbook$Price) ) %>% select(Book_title) 
```

Result:

```
The highest-rated of paperback is An Introduction to Database Systems.

```

2. Find books with more than 500 pages that have rating more than 4.5

```
Books %>%  select(Book_title , Price) %>% filter(Books$Rating > 4.5 & Books$Number_Of_Pages > 500)
```

## Part 4: Visualization with GGplot2
### 1.) Graph show relation between Type of Books and count.

// Set data
```

count_BookType <-table(Books$Type)
```
// Create graph
```

barplot(count_BookType,
        main = "Number of Each Type Book",   # Title of graphs
        xlab = "Type of Books",       # X-Axis Title
        ylab = "Number of Books",    # Y-Axis Title
        )
```
Result:

````
![Name](imageFile)
````


### 2.) Graph show relation of Hardcover Book between Rating and Price.


// Set data
```

Books %>% filter(Books$Type == "Hardcover") 
```
// Create graph
```

scat_plot<-Books %>% filter(Books$Type == "Hardcover") %>% ggplot(aes(x=Rating,y=Price))+geom_point()
scat_plot
```
Result:
